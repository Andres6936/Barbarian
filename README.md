# Barbarian!

A ~~Rogue~~Barbarian-like - created as an attempt to follow the famous [Python3 Roguelike tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/) using C++ and SDL2 as part of the [r/roguelikedev 2018 Tutorial Tuesday Challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/wiki/python_tutorial_series).

The master branch has the current ('stable') version of the game, which is currently on Part 4 of the tutorial.

I'll be updating [the blog](https://wsl-blog.com) with my thoughts and rambles about this project.

- [Week 1: Parts 0-2](https://wsl-blog.com/posts/2018-06-20-the-roguelike-tutorial-week1/): Setting up the project, getting the `@` moving, setting up the map.
- [Week 2: Parts 3](https://wsl-blog.com/posts/2018-06-25-the-roguelike-tutorial-week2/): The switch to SDL, dungeon generation.
- [Week 3: Part 4](https://wsl-blog.com/posts/2018-07-02-the-roguelike-tutorial-week3/): FoV and Bresenham's line drawing.

**Stay tuned for next week!**
