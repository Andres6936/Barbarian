# Barbarian!

A ~~Rogue~~Barbarian-like - created as an attempt to follow the famous [Python3 Roguelike tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/) using C++ and SDL2 as part of the [r/roguelikedev 2018 Tutorial Tuesday Challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/wiki/python_tutorial_series).

The master branch has the current ('stable') version of the game, which is currently on Part 8 of the tutorial, you can see the source for each part by checking the
tags under branches.

I'll be updating [the blog](https://wsl-blog.com) with my thoughts and rambles about this project.

- [Week 1: Parts 0-2](https://wsl-blog.com/posts/2018-06-20-the-roguelike-tutorial-week1/): Setting up the project, getting the `@` moving, setting up the map.
- [Week 2: Parts 3](https://wsl-blog.com/posts/2018-06-25-the-roguelike-tutorial-week2/): The switch to SDL, dungeon generation.
- [Week 3: Part 4](https://wsl-blog.com/posts/2018-07-02-the-roguelike-tutorial-week3/): FoV and Bresenham's line drawing.
- [Week 3b: Part 5](https://wsl-blog.com/posts/2018-07-10-the-roguelike-tutorial-week3b/): Adding entities, scheduling and pathfinding.
- [Week 4: Part 6-7](https://wsl-blog.com/posts/2018-07-18-the-roguelike-tutorial-week4/): Combat and a (rough) UI!
- [Week 5a: Part 8](https://wsl-blog.com/posts/2018-07-24-the-roguelike-tutorial-week5a/): Items and inventory!

**Stay tuned for next week!**

## Building Barbarian! From Source
So far, the build process has only been tested on Arch Linux. For most flavors of Linux, building should look like this:
- Make sure you have the SDL2 libraries installed from your package manager
- Open a terminal window, and navigate to your Downloads directory
- `git clone https://github.com/zwilder/barbarian`
- `cd Barbarian`
- `make` -- Tip: add the `-j` flag with the number of threads you want to speed up compile time (ie `-j4`)
- `make clean` -- This is optional, but will remove all the random build files cluttering the directory after make 

Adding compile instructions for other operating systems will be the first thing I tackle after the 7 week challenge is over.

## Playing the Game
- Move the player with the VI keys, the number pad, or the arrow keys
- `i` Inventory: Open your inventory, and then the letter corresponding to the item you wish to **use**
- `d` Drop: Open your inventory, and then the letter corresponding to the item you wish to **drop**
- `g` Get: Pickup an item
- `L` Look: Use the movement keys to look around, `Enter` or `Escape` to exit look mode 
- `F1` Fullscreen mode (may be wonky - again, haven't tested on anything other than Arch Linux)
- `<shift>+q` Quit
